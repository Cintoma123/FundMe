# FundMe
A simple crowdfunding smart contract built with Solidity that allows users to fund using native blockchain cryptocurrency while enforcing a minimum USD contribution via price feeds. Only the contract owner can withdraw the collected funds, and the project is designed for deployment and testing on a blockchain testnet.
